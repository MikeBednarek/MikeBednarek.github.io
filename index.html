        I am a member of the Varsity Baseball team,
        and an Economics tutor for the Academic Resource Center on campus. To contact me here is a link to my LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-bednarek-1b8919208"> This is another link</a>

      <p style="font-family:verdana; color:DodgerBlue;"> I am planning on joining the workforce after I graduate from Denison in the business or finance field. I'm also 
      interested in sports and would love to be an analyst for a professional sports team. One of my passions includes coaching baseball and I am planning on coaching 
      high school aged and above baseball players as well. </p>
